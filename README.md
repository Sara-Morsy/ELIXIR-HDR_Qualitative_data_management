# Qualitative-data-management
**Project leads:** Sara Morsy, Rob Free

This repository showcases our work from the ELIXIR-HDR hackathon, focusing on qualitative data management. 

**The project does not require any coding experience. It is open to anyone interested in qualitative health data research including healthcare professionals, FAIR enthusiasts, and data stewards.**

**We will be using the following tools for Brainstorming:**

## Overview
Qualitative data is essential to inform decisions in social and healthcare systems. This data focuses on participant experiences, and perceptions of different interventions. Moreover, it provides insights into “hows” and “whys” of different participant experiences and behaviours, helping healthcare professionals understand the challenges and impact of different interventions (1).

Effective re-use of qualitative data in secondary data analysis and meta-analysis is important for more comprehensive understanding of recurring themes, generalizing results across multiple systems and helping in evidence-based decision-making (2, 3).

Despite this (and unlike quantitative data), qualitative data secondary analysis is not common. Qualitative health data presents challenges for its reuse due to concerns about participants’ privacy and the nature of the data (3). This is a result of its narrative methodology, which can expose confidential information - especially in vulnerable populations. However, deidentification of data can remove context that is essential for its reuse - leading to decreased data quality and trustworthiness (3, 4).

Moreover, current data management plan approaches are not designed for some qualitative research designs e.g., ethnography (3, 4). Furthermore, current data repository structures are not suitable for qualitative data because there are no knowledge models and vocabularies that can be adopted without affecting the quality of the data. All of this contributes to the difficulty of adopting FAIR principles to qualitative health data (4).

In this project, we aim to start efforts to address challenges for qualitative data management, by tailoring it to different approaches of this form of data, particularly with relation to the FAIRification of qualitative health data. Our project will continue after the hackathon with the establishment of a working group focussed on this area.

## Objectives
- Identify current challenges in data management of different types of qualitative health data, including FAIRification and deidentification
- Search and collate existing guidelines and frameworks which could support qualitative data management.
- Prototype data standard to support qualitative data standards taking into account 1 and 2
## Expected outcomes:
- Whitepaper that presents our discussion which will help engage more researchers in addressing the challenges
- A GitHub repository for our project where participants can add resources, and it will be available to everyone after the hackathon
- Proof-of-concept developments for qualitative data standards and tooling
- Start discussions of possible solutions/tools to develop to fill in the gap in existing framework and initiatives (continued after the hackathon)
