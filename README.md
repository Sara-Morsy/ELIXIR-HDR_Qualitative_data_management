# Qualitative-data-management
This repository showcases our work from the ELIXIR-HDR hackathon, focusing on qualitative data management.
## Objectives
- Identify current challenges on data management of different types of qualitative health data, including FAIRification and deidentification
- Search and collate existing guidelines and frameworks which could support qualitative data management.
- Prototype data standard to support qualitative data standards taking into account 1 and 2
## Expected outcomes:
- Whitepaper that presents our discussion which will help engage more researchers in addressing the challenges
- A GitHub repository for our project where participants can add resources, and it will be available to everyone after the hackathon
- Proof-of-concept developments for qualitative data standards and tooling
- Start discussions of possible solutions/tools to develop to fill in the gap in existing framework and initiatives (continued after the hackathon)
